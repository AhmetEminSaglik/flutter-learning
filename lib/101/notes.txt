1-) to pick random images go to `random image` website and use the link
2-) if component is not common, special for the project, then code in `core` package. 
if components is common, special for the project then code in 'product' package.
3-) Row(mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround) 
 // to change main feature (horizontal)
- MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround : start,mid,end spaces
- MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween : mid spaces
- MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly : mid (mostly fix items to center) 
// to change extra feature (vertical)
- crossAxisAlignment : crossAxisAlignment.start   or 
                       crossAxisAlignment.end

!!!MOST IMPORTANT:
If there is a process, it should be added with a statefull widget, instead of adding in a same dart class.
For example there is a button,  when it is clicked, the number is increased. So this is a statefull widget
this widget is located in product package,and invoked the widget in page. (did not created the widget direct in the page class)
